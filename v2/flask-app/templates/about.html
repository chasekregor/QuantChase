  <h3>Creator:</h3>
  <p>Chase Kregor</p>
  <h3>Goal:</h3>
  <p>The goal of Quantified Chase was to create a dashboard of my life.</p>
  <h3>Background:</h3>
  <p>Quantified Chase was insipired by the Quantified Self movement. Upon buying an apple watch, I started to fall
    in love with the Health App, now that I had an Apple Watch I was feeding it all this
    interesting data about myself 24/7.
     I wondered if there was a way I could share all this data other people? This made me think about
     all the other various platforms that contained data about myself.
     And so I created Quantified Chase for three reasons:
     <ul>
       <li>Display my data to others for accountability</li>
       <li>Aggregate all my data for information gain</li>
       <li>A fun data science project</li>
     </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Data:</h3>
  <p>The data comes directly from my HealthKit.</p>
  <p>Disclaimer: Please don't do anything innapropriate with my data.</p>
  <h3>How Quantified Chase Works:</h3>
  <p>Healthkit -> QSAccess App -> Flask App -> Heroku </p>
  <h3>Next Steps & Future Work:</h3>
